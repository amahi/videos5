The default for Videos5 is to rescan your Videos folder(s) every night, at 4am.

If you'd like that to be more (or less) frequent, you can edit the cron entry.
As root, *crontab -u apache -e* will allow you to edit the apache user crontab, which is where the cron entry will be, if you installed Videos5 through Amahi. See [http://www.washington.edu/computing/unix/vi.html How to use vi] for some info on the default command-line text editor that will start, when you use the above crontab command.

The default is
{{{
0 4 * * *
}}}

To have it scan every hour, change it to this
{{{
0 * * * *
}}}

To have it scan every 2 hours, change it to this
{{{
0 */2 * * *
}}}
