If your Movies share contain folder.jpg and filename.tbn files (image files used by XBMC for thumbnails), those will be used to display thumbnails for folders and video files. More details about thumbnails can be found on the [XBMC wiki](http://wiki.xbmc.org/index.php?title=Thumbnails).

If you already use XBMC, and [indexed all your videos](http://wiki.xbmc.org/index.php?title=Video_Library), you can export your library using Settings > Video > Library > Export video library. Then indicate you want to export 'separate' files, instead of a 'single file' export, and that you want to export thumbnails and fanart. This will generate filename.tbn files for all your movies, and folder.jpg for all your TV Shows folders.

If you don't use XBMC, you can manually create filename.tbn files (in JPG or PNG format) for your movies, and place folder.jpg files (in JPG or PNG format) in your folders.

You can also use applications that can catalog your videos, and export thumbnails in the proper format. [Media Companion](http://www.billyad2000.co.uk/) and [Media Reader](http://www.24hourloop.com/projects/mediareader) are such applications.
